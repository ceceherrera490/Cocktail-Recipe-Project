# Cocktail Recipe Project

## Description

Cocktail Recipe is a JS application that leverages DOM manipulation to interact with the user. I developed this project because I have worked as a bartender for a few years and recognize how much the customer enjoys a great cocktail. I believe this app is a fun way to let people in on recipes, and how to create some of their favorite cocktails from home.
